<h1>Help me get back on my feet </h1>
<p>
I have never been good at asking others for help, but I don't have any other options right now. I was at the lowest point in my life, I was able to find my problems, face them, and have been working through them, there’s only so much that I can do on my own, and I need your help to get back up. I’ve been avoiding and trying to do anything to keep it from coming to this but please, read on, and hear me out. 
</p>
<h1>Some background </h1>
    <p>
I'm a life-long union organizer who has dedicated my career to fighting for workers' rights and social justice. But this year, everything fell apart for me. I lost my mom, my partner, and my job over a month. I fell into a deep depression and struggled to cope with the loss and the stress. I decided to go sober to improve my mental health, and I'm proud to say that I've been clean for five going on six weeks now and haven’t looked back. But I still have a long way to go to rebuild my life. 
</p>
<h1>Where I’m At </h1><p>
I've been out of work since April, and I've used up all my savings and resources just to survive. I'm now in danger of losing my home and having my utilities shut off. I need your help to keep a roof over my head and to pay my bills until I can find a new job. I'm not asking for much, just enough to cover my basic expenses and to give me some breathing room. Any amount you can spare, whether it's $5, $10, or $100, would make a huge difference for me. And if you can't donate, please share this appeal with your friends and family, even just saying hey if you read this would be so much right now, every bit of support counts. 
</p>
<h1>What’s next </h1><p>
I'm not giving up, I'm still looking for work as an organizer with local and national Unions, and I'm also open to any other opportunities that match my skills and experience. I'm also willing to do any handyman work that anyone may need. I have tools and I can travel. I'm confident that I can find a way to contribute to society and to make a positive impact. But I need your help to get through this rough patch. Please, if you can, donate anything and help me get back on my feet. Thank you for your kindness and generosity, I can’t stress how much you all mean to me.

Much Love, <br>
